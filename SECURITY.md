## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Email **security@sorobill.finance** with:

1. Description of the vulnerability
2. Steps to reproduce
3. Potential impact
4. Suggested fix (optional)

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and aim to release a fix within 14 days for critical issues.

## Security Considerations for Self-Hosters

- **`STELLAR_TREASURY_SECRET_KEY`** — this key signs all billing transactions. Treat it like a root password. Use a dedicated keypair with only the funds needed for operations.
- **`WEBHOOK_SIGNING_SECRET`** — rotate this if compromised. All registered endpoints will need to update their verification logic.
- **Database** — ensure PostgreSQL is not publicly accessible. Use connection pooling (e.g., PgBouncer) in production.
- **Redis** — enable Redis AUTH and bind to localhost or a private network only.
- **HTTPS** — always terminate TLS at the load balancer in production. Never run the API on plain HTTP in production.
- **Rate limiting** — the default is 100 req/min. Tighten this for public-facing deployments.

## Webhook authenticity

Always verify `X-Sorobill-Signature` with the endpoint secret before acting on
events. Reject bodies that fail timing-safe comparison.

## Frontend origin

Set `APP_FRONTEND_URL` to your real merchant UI (production:
`https://sorobill-app.vercel.app`). Do not leave wildcard CORS in production.

## Indexer write surface

Treat `POST /indexer/ingest` as privileged. Wallet auth in production prevents
unauthenticated flooding of mirrored events that dashboards trust.
